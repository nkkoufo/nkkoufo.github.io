        Hello, my name is Nikos Koufos. I am from York Springs PA. I graduated from Gettysburg Area High. I am currently enrolled at Penn State Behrend to major in software engineering with a minor in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I am expecting to graduate May 2019. How did I get so interested in computers you may be asking. Well it all started with a game called Minecraft within that game there is something called redstone, which the creator put in the game as a way of allowing programming. I found this aspect of the game very absorbing there was a way to do anything you wanted with it. I didn’t know at the time I was learning Computer engineering concepts such as logic gates, tape memory, and using simple logic gates to create things like flip flops and shift registers. I wanted more exposure, so junior year of high-school I took a c++ class. The next year I took AP Computer Science. After that I was hooked. I was also a swimmer as far back as I can remember qualifying for many different junior championships and making it up to the college level. I ended with 5th place in the Allegheny conference for 100 back and 200 back. Sadly 2016 was my last season as I decided to drop the sport for the addition of both my minors. I was also a member of Behrend’s Musican Club as a guitar player. I have been playing for 8 years now.
